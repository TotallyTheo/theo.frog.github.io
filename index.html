    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Theodore Van Wyk, I am a psychology graduate trying to turn software developer.
      I have always had a passion for software development and coding from highschool, but I only now got the chance to pursue it.
      If I am not working or studying, I am doing work on my Podcast that I have on the side.
      My family is really what motivates me to do well in my studies and in everything I do actually. Just being able to make them proud and being able to help and support them the way they have supported me, that is my goal. That's what gets me out of bed in the morning.
      I'm a coder, a gamer, a podcast creator, and to fund all these things, I am a working at heights facilitator by day
